        A NARROW SKY-SCRAPER.
        The Keimirk .hi- 'iSiiilttltir; to lie Erected
        In Sew York City.
        Perhaps the greatest curiosity in the
        building line ever designed to be erected in
        this city Is the new building of the Home
        Life Insurance Company,
        which will soon be under
        way on Broadway, near
        the corner of Slurry street.
        The plans wero drawn by
        Napoleon le Brun Sons,
        architect., selected in a
        competition between nine
        famous architects.
        The elevation, with a
        width of only 30 feet G
        inches on Broadway,
        shows a building of 12
        stories surmounted with
        a high gable roof, the ter
        minating finial of wliich
        will bo about is? feet
        above tlio sidewalk. The
        cornices of the building
        will be IC7 feet 3 inches In
        height from the street,
        and will not be quite as
        ____, although the roof
        will rise above the walls
        of the new Postal Tele
        graph Company's build
        ing alongside.
        The first story of the
        new 'tin- will have a
        celling height of 18 feet 6
        inches and will be ar
        ranged fur counting-room
        or banking purposes. The
        second story, to be used
        as the offices of the com
        pany, will be 23 feet 3
        inches in height on the
        Broad-fa* tront, and will
        have main and mezzanine
        floors in the rear. The
        depth of the building will
        bo 107 feet 6 inches, ami
        It will abut against the L
        of the Postal Telegraph
        Company's building.
        ln stylo the building
        will be of the severest
        kind of early Italian re
        naissance, and will be ab
        solutely fireproof. It will
        be thoroughly equipped
        with all the molern appli
        ances. The material for
        the front will probably be some shade of
        light brick. With the exception of the
        Tower Building, on lower Broadway, this
        is the narrowest high building in America.

        on a day like this If you dont like the
        Flatlron well hae it pulled down
        They might at least have left a little
        park there One of those Isles nf sar nr
        at a busy corner only more beautiful
        lou mean a sort of nenlnsuls nf
        safety with arm chairs for nervous
        ladles to drop right into after rmb
        the acnue and dodging the traffic Yes
        ana they could hae park attendants on
        hand with municipal smelling salts
        I dont care There should be a little
        park there with some fine monument or
        statue Then it would be almost as
        beautiful as our own Copley Square at
        home only different
        There I knew joud rine in Cnnlev
        Square before jou got through Eery
        bodjH know youre from Boston now
        Then they crossed Twent -third Strorr
        and went down Fifth Avenue she lin
        gering at the hook store and nlrtnrp
        store windows and he looking for a
        restaurant
        Did ou hear them chewing the rag
        about that building asked the big
        as being In some way a part of Great
        Britain and Americans had to pass as
        Englishmen because the brown men
        could not identify them in any other
        way
        THE TLUES WASHINGTON SUNDAY JULY 20 1902
        it used to be I wish the architects of
        that Flatlron had Inj Job for about half
        a day to answer questions about it
        Then the rush across the aenue got
        to the proper authorities without com
        ment probably thinking that qverjbody
        knew the consul as well as he dots
        But matters were confused and the
        committee reported that the King of
        Slam was to pay us a visit- and asked
        for an appropriation to entertain him
        thestnrv and began all over again finally
        getting the right answer twenty stories
        and an attic and adding There might
        be a cellar
        Now what do you think of that
        asked the cop when he cot a breathlne
        spell Some folks are actually timid
        about that building and aro afraid it
        will fall down or blow oicr Wouldnt
        take an office In It rent free
        Wc had a small hurricane hern Mow
        ing around this corner the other day
        and one man who came along wouldnt
        go by He said that building wasnt
        V 5S3H
        Yes you think that Just because a
        building is high its all right The Par
        thenon
        Now hold on No Parthenon In mine
        A View From an Upper Stoty
        a little more lively than usual and the
        policeman had to stop talking for pub
        lication and attend strictly to business
        waving back carriages horse and horse
        less starting them ahead holding up
        trolley cars pulling and pushing shop
        pers and waging his tongue as fast as
        his arms were going as follows
        Hurry madam Hold that horse
        back Its twenty stories high Yes
        yes its the Tlatlron Go ahead with
        that auto Now ladi rows oiir
        chance Twenti stories Dont knn
        what It cost Stop that car Three hun
        dred feet high Wait a minute Now
        quick madam Longer on Broadway
        than Fifth Avenue side Yes regular
        triangle Who said cuneiform Hold
        those horses or Ill run jou In Flat
        iron
        A policeman got rattled on that nnat
        for Just a minute the otherday Hed
        been sajing Flatiron for several
        hours and to the next questioner an
        elderly woman from out of town he
        said Laundry building by mistake
        What a wash what a wash they do
        have she exclaimed when aho rnt
        across and began to count stories
        She lost her count at the sixteenth
        safe In a gale and was going round an
        other way when his hat blew off and
        went plum over against the rintiron he
        was afraid of
        It was one of those Panama hats
        The fellow looked as if he wanted to
        ask me to get his hat but he didnt
        have the nerve for that
        Finally he edged over with one eye
        on Jhe flatiron and one on his Panama
        When he got it he sneaked backed on
        the run and went into the Fifth Avenue
        to get a drink I guess
        Youd thought that that skyscraper
        had been put up on purpose to fall
        down on that fellows head and that
        there was a man on tho Broadway side
        waiting to push it over That fellow
        was kind of a fool I guess Some say
        they wouldnt have an office In there
        rent free but hes the only one Ive
        struck who was afraid to go by
        Some think the flatlron Is the most
        wonderful thing in the way of engin
        eering and architecture they ever saw
        They all think something Why they
        talk about that flatiron more than they
        do about the King of Enirlnnl tti

        towers high above all the buildings in
        the neighborhood and from the north
        looks eo frail by reason of its great

        More persons pass the Junction of
        Broadway Fifth Avenue and Twentj
        third Street every day than any other
        point In New York It is right here
        that this wonderful building stands
        cause of its peculiar shape it has become
        to be popularly known as the flat
        iron
        Tho structure arouses considerably
        more comment on the part of visitors to
        the metropolis than anything else in
        New York The workmen on the ground
        the crossing policemen and the shop
        keepers in the vicinity are deluged with
        one continual string of questions and
        chatter regarding the building Ever one
        has something to say about it The fol
        lowing is a fair specimen of what is con
        tinually being said of tho peculiar-looking
        structure
        There is the Flatlron Building he
        fcaid as they reached the curb on the
        north side of Twenty third Street in
        inclr stroll down Fifth Avenue
        Its a shame she said
        She is studjing architecture and chic
        improvement because she likes to and
        has lots of ideas about such thincs
        Theyd better call It the old-fashioned
        name sadiron I suppose its
        iron and Im sure its sad she went
        on
        Whj V
        Why Why should they put a great
        big wedge like that right up there where
        the two greatest streets in the world
        cross each other Couldnt tbey let a
        little triangular patch of ground like
        that go to good green grass
        Ic heard that that little triangular
        can get grass lands for about a dollar
        an acre if jou go far enough out of
        town
        I dont care If Its worth four mil
        lions she said getting Indlgmnt
        Money isnt ev erj thing
        Its a wonderful building
        It Isnt beautiful Its Just a great
        chunk Why dont they call it the pie
        building It looks like a piece
        You might at least call it chocolate
        cake Its got twenty stories I mean
        lajers
        lives of thousands of women every week
        bj piloting them from enrh tn enrh
        Well Its the 3arae war all day long
        Some folks like that building and
        some dont but most all think Ifu minor
        when the first see it It sort of hursts
        on em suddenly and theyll stop right

        LOFTY OFFICE BUILDINGS.
        The Tallest and the Narrowest Now
        Being Completed in This City.
        "Where will the audacity of the builder of sky
        scrapers stop?" Such a question is likely to
        arise in the mind of the most casual observer
        -is he walks about the city. Within the last few
        months several structures have been erected
        which eclipsed any of their predecessors in the
        boldness of their design, and just at the present
        time two buildings are being completed in the
        Wall Street district which would seem to mani
        fest an especial contempt for the laws of
        nature. Neither one has towers, and in
        this lass of office buildings one is the
        tallest in the world and the other is the
        nairowest. Because of their extreme type
        both present a most fantastic appearance. The
        first has a rear addition twelve stories higher
        than its front, and consequently looks as if
        ready to turn a somersault. The second is so
        thin that it resembles a gigantic soda cracker
        stuck up edgewise.
        Vet the builders of these skyscrapers declare
        that they are far safer than the dwarfish, three
        and four storied, old brick buildings that they
        overtower. To these men neither one of these
        buildings appears especially remarkable. Neither
        one represents by any means the limit to their
        daiing and skill. As one of them said:
        "If it were not for the law we could build
        them as tall as the Eiffel Tower, and that is
        11. 1 feet high, or a little more than GOO feet above
        the tallest skyscraper in New-York."
        Ncr is this audacity confined alone to the
        architect who plant? or the contractor who
        "takes tin- job." Every workman Mem im
        bued with this same characteristic. The riveter
        may be seen climbing about the top of a steel
        column some three hundred or more feet above
        the street as nimbly as a monkey. Now and
        then he will hang from that dizzy height with
        only a bolthead under the toe of one foot, and
        the other leg twisted around a crosspiece. Now
        and then some workmen will go travelling sky
        ward astraddle of a beam which is being hoisted
        by the derrick on top of the steel frame, and
        so unconcerned are they of danger that they
        light their pipes as they sail aloft.
        A comparison of some of the most recent sky
        scrap, is with a few of the earlier ones shows
        how much more audacious are the builders of
        to-. than those of a few years ago. As soon
        as the theory of the steel skeleton for tali struct
        ures was discovered, about twenty years ago,
        it was used to construct buildings of great
        size, which ware regarded at that time as mar
        vels of the builders' art. These structures,
        however, spread more than they towered. The
        ground area of some of them was tremendous,
        and oven at the present time a few of them sur
        pass all their more modern rivals in the size of
        tie p round they cover. The Produce Exchange,
        erected in ISM. which was the first large steel
        cage building erected In New-York, covers more
        land than any other ofP.ce- building in the city.
        Its total ground area is r.7..V<() feet. Its height,
        i M including its tower, is 130 feet. With the
        touir it is S-~> feet hie.h.
        In striking contrast with the Produce Ex
        rini-.c Building is the Trinity Building, now in
        tie loarse of construction at No. ill Broadway.
        it shows how the present day builder piles up
        bis structure, instead of spreading it out. Al
        though its topmost oflice floor is nearly two
        and a half times higher tlan that of the Prod
        uce Exchange, it stands on a plol having an
        r.verage width of 42 feet, or one-fifth :is wide
        as tie exchange. The Trinity Building is Jl
        stories high, an I, although it has only 11, .".us
        Fo.ua- reel of ground area, leys than one-fifth

        handicap, the Hour area of 2Tr»,»>Ki feet la more
        than twenty times Its ground area. The floor
        area of the Produce Exchange is only a little
        more than eeven times the ground space.
        The Park Row Building, which with Its
        towers reaches a height of 3SO feet, higher taaa
        that attained by any other building in S v-
        York or elsewhere, has a floor area twenty-si.i
        times greater than that of the first story. Were
        the Produce Exchange to obtain such a propor
        tion, it would be necessary to pile upon the
        present bul ling three more of like size.
        In order to bring <>i t still more strongly th*
        flatness of the old and the si in. ness of the new
        style of office building, a few of the most striking
        examples of each are given in table form. Mo-:

        The flatiron form of structure, such as Is
        represented by the Fuller Building, in Twenty
        third-st., the Times Building. In Forty-see
        ond-st., which, with its tower, has a total height
        of 257 feet, which makes it rank second to the
        Park Row Building, and the Heaver Build!::?,
        at Beaver an 1 IVarl sts., is commonly regarded
        as the most scary type, but, as a matter of
        fact, it is the strongest. Its shape permits the
        best kind of bracing. In speaking of the Fuller
        Building. Paul Starrett. president of the George
        A. Fuller Company, who has his office on the
        eighteenth floor, said the other day:
        "Even in the heaviest gales 1 have never felt
        a tremor In this structure The wind has blown
        ninety miles in hour up here, and on one oc
        casion it knocked in some windows that had
        been put In temporarily before the building
        was finished, but it did not sway the steelwork
        one jot or tittle."
        Tut the upward tendency of the steel office
        building is not actuated so much by the ambi
        tion or pride of the maker as the business ne
        cessities of the owner. It is estimated that real
        estate on Manhattan Island is increasing in
        value at the rate of $100,000,000 a year. South
        at Central Park there are practically no vacant
        lots, and to the north they are disappearing at
        such a rate that such a builder as Charles T.
        Wills predicted recently that in fifteen years
        there will practically be none left. A compari-
        son of the vacant lots for the years li»«>«>. 1002
        and 1904 for the district east of Central Park.
        for example, will show how fast they are being
        built upon. In 1900 there were between Fifth
        ave.. Flfty-nlnth-sU Avenue B and •«i l -hun
        dred-and-twenty-flfth-st.. according t<» "The
        Record and Guide." 2,614 vacant avenue lots; in
        1902. 1.330; and this year, according to reports
        of the Buildings Department, there are only 700.
        The following percentages, taken in IMS by
        The Record and Guide." show the portion
        of space vacant in various Important West
        Side avenues: Central Park West. 31 per cent:
        Columbus-aye.. 7 per cent: Amaterdam-ave.. 17
        per cent; Broadway. 44 per cent; W»st End
        ave.. 27 per cent: Riverside Drive. 43 per
        cent. About one-half of this has since been built
        upon. Washington Heights, which up to the
        present time has been least developed. Is now
        building up fast, because of being made ac
        cessible to lower Manhattan by the subway.
        There were 211 vacant blocks in that region
        two years ago. according to 'The Record and
        Guide." and reports of the Buildings Department
        show that one-eighth of these have been built
        upon or will be built upon before the end of
        this year.
        The skyscrapers which are built on the sites
        of old buildings, however, are adding to the
        floor area of the city almost as fast as the
        buildings erected on vacant lots. In the year
        1903 101 buildings of nine stories or more were
        built in the district south of Leonard- at., which,
        according to Reginald P. Bolton. an engineer
        who ha-s planned the mechanical equipment of
        many of the .largest skyscrapers In the ity.
        has added ISO acres of floor area to that part
        of the city. This increase, it Is estimated. h;u»
        given 15 per cent more room, as the land area
        of this district is only 1.152 acres.

        ERA OF SKYSCRAPERS
        Skeleton Construction Began
        Seventeen Years Ago.
        PIONEER STRUCTURE

        THE MULTIPLE USES OF THE TALL
        BUILDINGS.

        First Built for Office Purposes Exclu
        sively, but Now for Homes,
        Schools and Factories.
        Written for Tho Star.
        Seventeeen years ago next Tuesday the
        work of construction was begun on the build
        ing which made the skyscraper possible.
        Within the next few weeks the work of
        tearing1 it down will be under way, and on
        the site will be erected a twenty-story office
        building at an estimated cost of a million
        and a half dollars.
        This pioneer structure, whose days are
        numbered. Is known as the Tower building,
        is located at 50 Broadway, New York, and
        is generally recognized among architects
        and constructing engineers as embodying
        the first radical application of a thorough
        going system of skeleton construction, the
        essential of the skyscraper.
        In some quarters It may still be held that
        this distinction does not rightfully belong
        to the Tower building. For many years
        after its construction a hot discussion was
        waged as to whether the Tower building
        was the pioneer, many claims for this honor
        being made by the architects of other build
        ings erected either shortly before or about
        the time that Bradford L. Gilbert, as archi
        tect, filed the plans for the Tower building.
        Of recent years, however, there has been
        little or no disputation concerning the
        Tower building's right to the distinction.
        This change was brought about largely by
        the careful and thorough investigation con
        ducted to settle this mooted Question by
        The Real Estate Record and Builders'
        Guide of New York city In 1898. This is
        what that publication, an authority broad
        ly recognized, had to say:
        New Light on Height of Skyscrapers.
        But though it has been highly practicable
        since the construction of the Tower build
        ing to run up buildings to heights undream
        ed of before, and there are structures vary
        ing from twenty-five to thirty stories in
        altitude above the surface, it is a note
        worthy fact that the average height of all
        buildings above the practical limit possible
        under the old system of construction Is far
        from being what one would naturally sup
        pose it to be after spending a day looking
        upward at the towering structures in the
        business centers of such cities as New
        York. Chicago, Philadelphia and Pittsburg.
        It was during the three years immediate
        ly prior to the outbreak of the war with
        Spain that there seemed to be a mania in
        New York for putting up record-breaking
        structures, in the point of altitude. Then
        were constructed the Park Row building,
        the highest office building in the world;
        the St. Paul building, almost as tall: the
        Empire building, and many others whose
        course of construction was followed pretty
        generally all over the country with much
        wonder and comment. During these three
        years In New York eighty-six buildings,
        ton stories and over In height were erect
        ed, and yet, notwithstanding the efforts on
        the part of many builders to put up ex
        ceedingly high buildings, the average height
        of each of the eighty-six buildings was only
        thirteen and a half stories.
        These three years saw the erection of the
        highest skyscrapers to date. Since then the
        tendency has been to erect buildings more
        on a level, as the figures for 190:1-4 and the
        present year up to May show. During this
        period there hsive been constructed In New
        York 111 buildings of all descriptions ten
        stories high and over In altitude, with an
        average height of a fraction over twelve
        stories, the fraction not being sufficient to
        permit of a garret of even small dimen
        sions.
        In this connection It Is worth noting that
        during these years only seven buildings
        above fifteen stories have been erected, of
        which four have sixteen, two eighteen and
        one twenty-six stories, respectively. From
        18St5 to ISA", Inclusive, fifteen buildings over
        fifteen stories In height were erected, divid
        ed as follows: One thirty, one twenty-six,
        one twenty-one, two twenty, one nineteen,
        five eighteen and four sixteen stories.
        This lessening of the heischt of sky
        scrapers is being explained In this fashion:
        Every story added to a building means In
        creased elevator service. That means, besides
        Increased cost of operation of the building,
        decreased income from renting, for more
        space must necessarily be given over to
        elevator shafts. Time has pretty thorough
        ly proved that a skyscraper is not the
        money-maker it was thought at first it
        would be. In fact, the owner of a sky
        scraper who makes 3 per cent on his in
        vestment should think himself lucky. So,
        It can readily be seen why the tendency of
        latter years has been to bring down the
        average height of skyscrapers below that
        of ten years ago.

        ALLEST SKYSCRAPER
        IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
        Engineers, architects, and bulldem
        everywhere are Interested In the plana
        made public from New York for a
        skyscraper that will out skyscrape
        anything yet built. These plans were
        filed with the New York building de
        partment by Ernest Flagg, for the
        proposed Singer building. Nothing
        more radical has ever been attempted
        on either side of the ocean than Is
        embodied in the plans for this struc
        ture. The building is to be forty
        stories high and other buildings in New
        York and Chicago which now causa
        people to become stiff-necked looking
        up at them will, by comparison, appear
        small.
        Two of the tallest Chicago buildings,
        the Masonic Temple and the Majestic
        Theater, would be but one story high
        er than the Singer building, if on*
        was placed on top of the other. There
        will be 595 feet of the structure above
        ground and probably 125 feet of It
        below the street surface, bo that, all
        told, it will be ten feet longer than the
        mammoth* Amerlka, the .biggest steam
        ship afloat
        It was supposed the limit bad been
        reached in this style of structure, but
        it seems not Before long a fifty story
        pile may be expected to make slow go
        ing people gasp.
        While Chicago was the pioneer in the
        erection of tall buildings, it has tn
        the last few years been far outstrip
        ped by New York. The constantly in
        creasing population of Manhattan Isl
        and and the impossibility of increas
        ing the ground area for the accommo
        dation of the people made it neces
        sary to run the buildings higher and
        higher until it is impossible to tell
        when the limit will be reached.

        TALLEST BUILDING IN WORLD
        Proposed Structure Will Be Erected to
        House Goods for South and Cen
        tral American Trade.
        New York. Here is projected the
        tallest building in the world. It is
        still Ik embryo, but has progressed to
        the stage of blue print and architectu
        ral plan. The site has. not yet been
        selected, but if this great conception
        should gain the essential financial sup
        port of the parties interested Ameri
        can manufacturers who desire to es
        tablish their goods in South and Cen
        tral American markets, and the big
        Southern-American concerns who be
        lieve in the great opportunity of foster
        ing commercial relations between the
        wo Americas it will probably tower
        among the great structures arising
        around the new terminal of the New
        York Central.
        It is to be more than a commercial
        structure, however, for it is to house
        the club rooms and exhibition halls
        of the Pan-American States associa
        tion, which is now engaged in the" im
        portant task of introducing the two
        interests to one another.
        The design calls for a wonderful
        Spanish tower, pinnacled with red
        and gold, 900 feet in height. That is
        151 feet higher than the Woolworth,
        the present record holder among the
        world's tall buildings.
        Of course, the Eiffel Tower of Paris
        is higher yet, with its 304 meters, or
        approximately 1,000 feet. But the Eif
        fel tower is not either in form or pur
        pose a building; it is rather an engi
        neering demonstration along the lines
        of steel bridge construction, and beats
        about the same relation to a building
        proper that a fire escape or an exten
        sion ladder does to a staircase.
        The step ladder order of Manhat
        tan'sand that means the world's
        half-dozen champion skyscrapers will
        therefore line up as follows:
        Pan-American, 901 feet; Woolworth,
        750 feet; Metropolitan Life, 700 feet;
        Singer, 612 feet; Bankers' Trust, 539
        feet; Park Row, 3S2 feet.
        The estimated cost of this latest
        building designed by Francis H. Kim
        ball who is the architect of the City
        Investing building, the Manhattan Life
        and a dozen other of the colossal struc
        tures that have helped to make down
        town New York famous rather stuns
        the imagination, as do other figures
        mentioned in association with this
        project.
        The Pan-American building will call
        for some 21,000,000 cubic feet of build
        ing material of various kinds steel,
        granite, terra cotta, concrete, tiling,
        bronze, iron, glass, etc.
        Its estimated cost will be from $10,
        000,000 to $12,000,000.
        The main structure is to be 33 sto
        ries high, above which the tower, with
        its efflorescence of spires and cupolas
        in the general style of the Spanish re
        naissance, will soar to the altitude of
        901 feet.

        DAYLIGHT SAVING
        TO GIVE WORKERS
        TIME FOR PLAY
        'hysicians Believe Move Will
        Do Much to Better the
        Health of Many
        Men who like the great outdoors.'
        ho like to leave the offices for a
        alk. a little fishing trip nnd a round
        f golf—to-day praised the passage 1
        t the daylight-saving bill by Con- j
        ress.
        Physicians here to-day also were j
        f the opinion that tho new sched- j
        le. to become effective Easter Sun
        ay, will do much for thd healUi j
        fa great number of workers who'
        or the first time will have a chance
        3 get out into the parks and fields,
        fter a day's work.
        Businessmen generally tli rough-
        out the city this afternoon declared
        that the changing of hours would
        be accomplished without interrupt
        ing or hurting trade. It was said
        that tho change would mean little
        or nothing to the larger mills ahd
        munitions plants, where three shifts
        of men now ure engaged in working
        throughout the twenty-four hours, j
        No difficulty will be experienced in
        trolley car schedules, it was said at
        the offices of the Harrisburg and
        'cross-river traction companies and
        the turning of the watch will do
        the trick. i
        Theaters, railroads and every bus-
        iness house in the city will operate
        according to the now schedule, and,
        therefore, it was pointed out, there
        can be 110 confusion after a man
        has once reset his watch.
        Summed up, Mr, Littlefleld says:
        "The bill provides tor an hour
        advance in standard time at 2
        o'clock a. in. on the last Sunday
        in .March of each yefcr and at
        a. m. the lust Sunday in October
        uie standard time shall be retarded
        one hour. Eleven countries have
        adopted the summer daylight sav-
        ing plan. The first was Germany,
        then Great Britain, France, Austria-
        Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Denmark,
        Norway, Holland, Portugal and Au-/
        stralla. London, England, saved
        200,000 tons of coal during a sum
        mer. In England in five and one
        half months $12,000,000 in coal '.vere
        saved, and In France $10,000,000. It
        is estimated that in the United States
        $10,000,000 can be saved in light
        bills. The hour of daylight con
        served by the proposed law can be
        used by industrial workers throug
        out America for gardening and agri
        cultural work. This will be a most
        important gain. We are sure of a
        great shortage in farm labor this
        summer and something must be done
        to offset the probable loss in pro
        duction of farm products. The hour
        saved for daylight every day in April.
        May, June, July, August, September
        and October will be of inestimable
        value in stimulating the dwellers in
        cities and towns to interest them
        selves in the production of garden
        truck."
        PASS DAYLIGHT
        SAVING BILL;
        AWAITS WILSON
        Clocks All Over Country Will
        Be Turned Ahead
        One Hour
        Wusliington, Mar. 16—The House
        of Representatives, by 252 to 40. yes
        terday passed the Senate daylight
        saving bill, under the terms of
        which, when it receives the signa
        ture of President Wilson, it'will be
        required that all the clocks in the
        United States be turned ahead one
        hour at 2 a. m. 011 Sunday, March
        31, and remain advanced one hour
        until 2 a. m. on the last Sunday in
        October.
        Under the bill parsed by the
        Senate the limit was, fixed as the
        last Sunday in September. The
        House amendment extending the
        daylight saving one month was
        adopted upon representations by-
        Fuel Administrator Garfield that a
        great amount of l'uel would be con
        served thereby. It is expected that
        the Senate will concur in the amend
        ment to-morrow.
        Five standard time zones for th
        United States will be fixed by the
        Government, according to the bill,
        and it is made mandatory upon the
        railroads to follow the standard
        time.
        By the passage of the bill, tho
        United States joins with England,
        France, Switzerland, Portugal and
        the three Scandinavian countries in
        adopting a method of economy and
        efficiency first taken by Germany
        during the early days of the war.
        Millions of tons .of coal have been
        saved in these countries, it was
        stated to the House to-day by the
        supporters of the measure, by the
        simple means of turning the clock
        ahead over a period of five or six
        months a year.
        England reports a saving of 12,-
        000,000 tons up to date. Several
        Representatives who espoused tha
        bill admitted that when it was first
        proposed they considered it silly.
        But, they said, when they came to
        examine its virtues they fell enthu
        siastically behind it.
        Provided the President signs it,
        and there is little doubt that he will
        do so quickly, the daylight-saving
        bill will have the effect of turning
        us all out of bed an hour earlier
        than we have been accustomed-to
        arise and of sending us back again
        accordingly. The use of fuel at
        night will be conserved by the clos
        ing of establishments at 11 o'clock
        which ordinarily do business until
        12 o'clock. By the clock on the wall
        it will still be 12 o'clock, but by
        the moral conviction it. will be 11.
        Officials of the Chamber of Com
        merce and the Bourse, two of the
        many local organisations which car
        ried the light for the daylight-sav
        ing bill into the very halls of Con
        fess. were jubilant on receipt of
        the news that the legislation was
        so near. Ernest T. Trigg, president
        of the Chamber of Commerce, said:
        "This is very gratifying to us. By
        a readjusting of working hours the
        war industries will be speeded up
        materially and more time for the
        cultivation of war gardens will re
        sult."
        Emil P. Albrecht, president of the
        Bourse, said:
        "This legislation will enable work
        ers to get better results out of their
        daily efforts, as they will be in bet
        ter tune for speeding up operations
        in the early daylight hours of the
        summer months. In such a large
        manufacturing center as Philadel
        phia the gain in efficiency in the
        various war work lines will be tre
        mendous. Only on Monday last the
        directors of the Bourse urged upon
        Congress for the second time within
        two months the necessity for this
        change."

        These charts show vividly how the daylight saving plan will give j
        everybody more "free hour#" of daylight. You've heard this: "Well,!
        there are just so many hours of daylight in a day and you can't change j
        'em." But wait?the daylight hours before your work-day itarts are
        so-called "wasted hours"?you ?leep them away or spend them getting
        ready to go to work. The daylight saving plan merely "shifts" an
        hour of daylight to the "free hours" after work, when you can use it.
        The tables is based on the average June day and the workday from
        8 to 5 includes an hour for lunch.
        Moving the Clock.
        The clock will be set forward one
        hour at 2 a. m., March SI, according
        to the House bill. At the same hour
        on October 27, the clock will be set
        back.
        The present standard time rones
        will remain in effect.
        Both changes will take place on
        Sunday mornings so that the least
        possible wrench may be given to
        the industrial fabric of the nation.
        But even at that on the railroads
        alone there will be some 1.000 pas
        senger trains and 5.000 trains run

        Benefits of Plan.
        The following benefits will be
        reaped by the daylight-saving plan:

        March 31, under the so-called day
        light-saving bill, pessed yesterday by
        the House, 252 to 40.
        Senator Calder, author of the
        ure In the upp?r braftch iftf Congress,
        said the House amendments would
        be agreed to, so that a conference
        would not be necessary.
        Provisions of Bill.
        The bill provides that at 2 o'clock
        p. m. on the last Sunday In March
        each year, clocks all over the country
        which affect any operations of the
        Federal government, or railroads,
        i shall be set ahead one hour. At 2
        j o'clock p. m., the last Sunday in Oc
        j tober of each year, they are to be
        i retarded one hour.
        j All business relating in any way
        to the Federal government will be
        conducted on the time set. Further

        tMe various sones as United fctates
        Standard F-astern time, TTnlted States
        Standard Central time, etc.
        Inasmuch as commercial and labor
        organizations the country over have
        petitioned for the bill, Congress ex
        pects a general agreement with the
        law everywhere. The five sones are
        to be fixed by order of the Inter
        state Commerce Commission. But it
        Is directed in the bill to have "due
        regard" for present railroad classi
        fications. The unofficial understand
        ing is that no important change is
        to be made in present arrangements.
